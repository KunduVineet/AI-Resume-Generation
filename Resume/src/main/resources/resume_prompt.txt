Generate a professional IT job resume in JSON format based on the following description:
{userDescription}

Instructions:
- Extract only the details explicitly provided in the description, such as fullName, jobTitle, company, and any other specific information (e.g., email, phoneNumber, location, linkedIn, gitHub, portfolio, skills, etc.).
- Do not infer or fabricate details beyond what is explicitly stated. If a detail is missing, use 'Not provided' for strings or leave arrays empty.
- Use camelCase for all JSON keys (e.g., fullName, jobTitle).
- Ensure URLs (e.g., linkedIn, gitHub, portfolio) start with 'https://' if provided in the description, otherwise use 'Not provided'.
- Dates must be in 'MMM YYYY' format for durations (e.g., 'Jan 2020') and full years for graduationYear (e.g., '2020'). If exact dates are not provided, use a reasonable approximation based on the description or 'Not provided'.
- Arrays must always be present, even if empty.
- The summary should be a concise statement based solely on the description, without adding unstated details.
- Properly format the JSON with 2-space indentation.
